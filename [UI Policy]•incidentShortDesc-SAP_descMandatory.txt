Note2: In UI Policy Actions, if you tick “Clear if true”, the value for the selected field name will clear it when the condition in When to Apply is met.
Note3: In UI Policy form, if you tick “Reverse is false”, means when the condition is false - Short desc does NOT contain SAP, the desc will not become mandatory
